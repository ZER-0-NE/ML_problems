    "In a store, all vegetables are placed in the same aisle, all dairy items are placed together and cosmetics form another set of such groups. Investing time and resources on deliberate product placements like this not only reduces a customer’s shopping time, but also reminds the customer of what relevant items (s)he might be interested in buying, thus helping stores cross-sell in the process. Association rules help uncover all such relationships between items from huge databases. One important thing to note is-\n",

    "    Rules do not extract an individual’s preference, rather find relationships between set of elements of every distinct transaction. This is what makes them different from collaborative filtering.\n",
    "    \n",
    "To elaborate on this idea — Rules do not tie back a users’ different transactions over time to identify relationships. List of items with unique transaction IDs (from all users) are studied as one group. This is helpful in placement of products on aisles. On the other hand, collaborative filtering ties back all transactions corresponding to a user ID to identify similarity between users’ preferences. This is helpful in recommending items on e-commerce websites, recommending songs on spotify, etc."
