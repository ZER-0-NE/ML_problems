    "So, how does one tell a neural network how far it is from our desired output? **In comes the Loss Function to the rescue.**\n",

    "    <img src = \"assets/11.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Loss function curve depicted above is an ideal version. In real-world cases, the Loss function may not be so smooth, with some bumps and saddles points along the way to the minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different kinds of loss functions each essentially calculating the error between predicted output and desired output. Here we’ll use one of the simplest loss functions, the squared-error Loss function. Defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/12.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the square keeps everything nice and positive and the fraction (1/2) is there so that it cancels out when taking the derivative of the squared term (it is common among some machine learning practitioners to leave the fraction out).\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, the Squared Error Loss function helps us in minimizing the vertical distance between our predictor line(blue line) and actual data(green dot). Behind the scenes, this predictor line is our z(linear function) node.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/13.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know the purpose of a Loss function let’s calculate the error in our current prediction ŷ=0.5, given y=0\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/14.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "as we can see the Loss is 0.125. Given this, we can now use the derivative of the Loss function to check whether we need to increase or decrease our weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This process is called backpropagation**, as we’ll be doing the opposite of the forward phase. Instead of going from input to output we’ll track backward from output to input. Simply, backpropagation allows us to figure out how much of the Loss each part of the neural network was responsible for.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To perform backpropagation we’ll employ the following technique: at each node, we only have our local gradient computed(partial derivatives of that node), then during backpropagation, as we are receiving numerical values of gradients from upstream, we take these and multiply with local gradients to pass them on to their respective connected nodes.**\n",

    "    <img src = \"assets/15.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is a generalization of the chain rule from calculus.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since ŷ(predicted label) dictates our Loss and y(actual label) is constant, for a single example, we will take the partial derivative of Loss with respect to ŷ\n",

So then, how do we get our desired output in this instance if we can’t figure out how to adjust the weights? The key thing to note here is that the local gradients (∂z/∂w₁ and ∂z/∂w₂) are x₁ and x₂, both of which, in this example, happens to be zero (i.e. provide no information)**\n",

    "Note that without the bias term a line can only pass through the origin(0, 0) and the only differentiating factor between lines would then be the gradient m.\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "So, using this new information let’s add another node to a neural network; the bias node. (In neural network literature, every layer, except the input layer, is assumed to have a bias node, just like the linear node, so this node is also often omitted in figures.)\n",

    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/25.png/\">\n",

    "Now let’s do a forward propagation with the same example, x₁=0, x₂=0, y=0 and let’s set bias, b=0 (initial bias is always set to zero, rather than a random number), and let the backpropagation of Loss figure out the bias.\n",

    "    <img src = \"assets/26.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",

    "Well, the forward propagation with a bias of “b=0” didn’t change our output at all, but let’s do the backward propagation before we make our final judgment.\n",

    "As before let’s go through backpropagation in a step by step manner.\n",

    "**Hurrah! we just figured out how much to adjust the bias. Since the derivative of bias(∂L/∂b) is positive 0.125, we will need to adjust the bias by moving in the negative direction of the gradient(recall the curve of the Loss function from before).** This is technically called **gradient descent,** as we are “descending” away from the sloping region to a flat region using the direction of the gradient.\n",

    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/30.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",

This slight correction is something that the neural network has ‘learned’ just by comparing its predicted output with the desired output, y, and then moving in the direction opposite of the gradient. Pretty cool, right?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you may be wondering, this is only a small improvement from the previous result and how do we get to the minimum Loss. Two things come into play: \n",
    "a) how many iterations of ‘training’ we perform (each training cycle is forward propagation followed by backward propagation and updating the weights through gradient descent). \n",
    "b) the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see **learning rate**:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning Rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall, how we calculated the new bias, above, by moving in the direction opposite of the gradient(i.e. gradient descent).\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/33.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that when we updated the bias we moved 1 step in the opposite direction of the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/34.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**We could have moved 0.5, 0.9, 2, 3 or whatever fraction of steps we desired in the opposite direction of the gradient. This ‘number of steps’ is what we define as the learning rate, often denoted with α(alpha).**\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/35.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning rate defines how quickly we reach the minimum loss. Let’s visualize below what the learning rate is doing:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/36.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see with a lower learning rate(α=0.5) our descent along the curve is slower and we take many steps to reach the minimum point. On the other hand, with a higher learning rate(α=5) we take much bigger steps and reach the minimum point much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The keen-eyed may have noticed that gradient descent steps(green arrows) keep getting smaller as we get closer and closer to the minimum, why is that? Recall, that the learning rate is being multiplied by the gradient at that point along the curve; as we descend away from sloping regions to flatter regions of the u-shaped curve, near the minimum point, the gradient keeps getting smaller and smaller, thus the steps also get smaller. Therefore, changing the learning rate during training is not necessary(some variations of gradient descent start with a high learning rate to descend quickly down the slope and then reduce it gradually, this is called **“annealing the learning rate” or “learning rate decay”)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So what’s the takeaway? Just set the learning rate as high possible and reach the optimum loss quickly. NO. Learning rate can be a double-edged sword. Too high a learning rate and the parameters(weights/biases) don’t reach the optimum instead start to diverge away from the optimum. To small a learning rate and the parameters take too long to converge to the optimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/37.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Small learning rate(α=5*10⁻¹⁰) resulting is numerous steps to reach the minimum point is self-explanatory; multiply gradient with a small number(α) results in a proportionally small step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large learning rate(α=50) causing gradient descent to diverge may be confounding, but the answer is quite simple; note that at each step gradient descent approximates its path downward by moving in straight lines(green arrows in the figures), in short, it estimates its path downwards. When the learning rate is too high we force gradient descent to take larger steps. Larger steps tend to overestimate the path downwards and shoot past the minimum point, then to correct the bad estimate gradient descent tries to move towards the minimum point but again overshoots past the minimum due to the large learning rate. This cycle of continuous overestimates eventually cause the results to diverge(Loss after each training cycle increase, instead of decrease).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning rate is what’s called a hyper-parameter.** Hyper-parameters are parameters that the neural network can’t essentially learn through backpropagation of gradients, they have to be hand-tuned according to the problem and its dataset, by the creator of the neural network model. (The choice of the Loss function, above, is also hyper-parameter)\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the goal is not the find the “perfect learning rate ” but instead a learning rate large enough so that the neural network trains successfully and efficiently without diverging.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, far we’ve only used one example(x₁=0 and x₂=0) to adjust our weights and bias(actually, only our bias up till now) and that reduced the loss on one example from our entire dataset(OR gate table). But we have more than one example to learn from and we want to reduce our loss across all of them. Ideally, in one training iteration, we would like to reduce our loss across all the training examples. This is called Batch Gradient Descent(or full batch gradient descent), as we use the entire batch of training examples per training iteration to improve our weights and biases. (Other forms are mini-batch gradient descent, where we use a subset of the data set in each iteration and stochastic gradient descent, where we only use one example per training iteration as we’ve done so far).\n",
    "\n",
    "A training iteration where the neural network goes through all the training examples is called an **Epoch**. If using mini-batches then an epoch would be complete after the neural network goes through all the mini-batches, similarly for stochastic gradient descent where a batch is just one example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we proceed further we need to define something called a Cost Function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cost Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "When we perform “batch gradient descent” we need to slightly change our Loss function to accommodate not just one example but all the examples in the batch. This adjusted Loss function is called the Cost Function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, note that the curve of the Cost Function is similar to the curve of the Loss function(same U-Shape).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of calculating the Loss on one example the cost function calculates average Loss across ALL the examples.\n",

    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/38.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuitively, the Cost function is expanding out the capability of the Loss function. Recall, how the Loss function was helping to minimize the vertical distance between a single data point and the predictor line(z).

    "\n",
    "1. For each training iteration create separate temporary variables(capital deltas, Δ) that will accumulate the gradients(small deltas, δ) for the weights and biases from each of the “m” examples in our training set, then at the end of the iteration update the weights using the average of the accumulated gradients.

The only way we can achieve this, given the local gradient(∂Z/∂b) is just equal to 1, is by summing up the upstream gradient.\n",

    "On a final note when deriving derivative expressions work on small examples and then generalize from there. For example here, while calculating the derivative of the dot product w.r.t to W, we used a single column vector as a test case and generalized from there, if we would have used the entire data matrix then the derivative would have resulted in a (4 × 1 × 2) tensor (multidimensional matrix), calculation on which can get a bit hairy.\n",

For example, in a housing dataset where the input features are the width and length of houses in yards and label is the location of the house on the map, a better predictor for this location could be the feature cross between width and length of houses, giving us a new feature of “size of house in square yards”.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Concluding:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1- So, which one is better Feature Engineering or a Deep Neural Network?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the answer depends on many factors. Generally, if we have a lot of training data we can just use a deep neural net to achieve acceptable accuracy, but if data is limited we may need to perform some feature engineering to extract more performance out of our neural network. As you saw in the feature engineering example above, to make good feature crosses one needs to have intimate knowledge of the dataset they are working with.\n",
    "Feature engineering along with a deep neural network is a powerful combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2- How to count the number of layers in a Neural Network?**\n",
    "By convention, we don’t count layers without tunable weights and bias. Therefore, though the input layer is a separate “layer” we don’t count it when specifying the depth of a neural network.\n",
    "So, our last example was a “2 layer neural network” (one hidden + output layer) and all the examples before it just a “1 layer neural network” (output layer, only).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3- Why use Activation Functions?**\n",
    "Activation functions are nonlinear functions and add nonlinearity to the neurons. The feature crosses are a result of stacking the activation functions in hidden layers. The combination of a bunch of activation functions thus results in a complex non-linear decision boundary. In this blog, we used the sigmoid/logistic activation function, but there are many other types of activation functions(ReLU being a popular choice for hidden layers) each providing a certain benefit. The choice of the activation function is also a hyper-parameter when creating neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without activations functions to add nonlinearity, no matter how many linear functions we stack up the result of them will still be linear. Consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/115.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use any nonlinear function as an activation function. Some researchers have used even cos and sin functions. Preferably the activation function should be a continuous i.e. no breaks in the domain of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4- Why Random Initialization of Weights?**\n",
    "This question is much easier to answer now. Note that if we had set all the weights in a layer to the same value than the gradient that passes through each node would be the same. In short, all the nodes in the layer would learn the same feature about the data. Setting the weights to random values helps in breaking the symmetry of weights so that each node in a layer has the opportunity to learn a unique aspect of the training data\n",
    "There are many ways to set weights randomly in neural networks. For small neural networks, it is ok to set the weights to small random values. For larger networks, we tend to use “Xavier” or “He” initialization methods(will be in the coding section). Both these methods still set weights to random values but control their variance. For now, its suffice to say use these methods when the network does not seem to converge and the Cost becomes static or reduces very slowly when using the “plain” method of setting weights to small random values. Weight initialization is an active research area and will be a topic for a future “Nothing but Numpy” blog.\n",
    "Biases can be randomly initialized, too. But in practice, it does not seem to have much of an effect on the performance of a neural network. Perhaps this is because the number of bias terms in a neural network is much fewer than the weights.\n",
