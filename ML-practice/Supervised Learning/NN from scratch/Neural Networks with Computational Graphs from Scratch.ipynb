    "Neural networks are a model inspired by how the brain works. Similar to neurons in the brain, our ‘mathematical neurons’ are also, intuitively, connected to each other; they take inputs(dendrites), do some simple computation on them and produce outputs(axons).\n",

    "w₁ and w₂ represent our weight vectors (in some neural network literature it is denoted with the theta symbol, θ). Intuitively, these dictate how much influence each of the input features should have in computing the next node. \n",

    "Sigmoid is one of the many “activations functions” used in neural networks. The job of an activation function is to change the input to a different range. For example, if z > 2 then, σ(z) ≈ 1 and similarly, if z < -2 then, σ(z) ≈ 0. So, the sigmoid function squashes the output range to (0, 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "In our above neural network since it is the last node, it performs the function of output. The predicted output is denoted by ŷ.

    "Data flows from left-to-right in our neural network. In technical terms, this process is called **‘forward propagation’**; the computations from each node are forwarded to the next node, it is connected to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s go through all the computations our neural network will perform on given the first example, x₁=0, and x₂=0. Also, we’ll initialize weights w₁ and w₂ to w₁=0.1 and w₂=0.6 (recall, these weights a have been randomly selected)\n",

    "\n",
    "So, how does one tell a neural network how far it is from our desired output? **In comes the Loss Function to the rescue.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Loss Function is a simple equation that tells us how far our neural network’s predicted output(ŷ) is from our desired output(y), for ONE example, only.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivative of the loss function dictates whether to increase or decrease weights. A positive derivative would mean decrease the weights and negative would mean increase the weights. The steeper the slope the more incorrect the prediction was.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/11.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Loss function curve depicted above is an ideal version. In real-world cases, the Loss function may not be so smooth, with some bumps and saddles points along the way to the minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different kinds of loss functions each essentially calculating the error between predicted output and desired output. Here we’ll use one of the simplest loss functions, the squared-error Loss function. Defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/12.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the square keeps everything nice and positive and the fraction (1/2) is there so that it cancels out when taking the derivative of the squared term (it is common among some machine learning practitioners to leave the fraction out).\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, the Squared Error Loss function helps us in minimizing the vertical distance between our predictor line(blue line) and actual data(green dot). Behind the scenes, this predictor line is our z(linear function) node.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/13.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know the purpose of a Loss function let’s calculate the error in our current prediction ŷ=0.5, given y=0\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/14.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "as we can see the Loss is 0.125. Given this, we can now use the derivative of the Loss function to check whether we need to increase or decrease our weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This process is called backpropagation**, as we’ll be doing the opposite of the forward phase. Instead of going from input to output we’ll track backward from output to input. Simply, backpropagation allows us to figure out how much of the Loss each part of the neural network was responsible for.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To perform backpropagation we’ll employ the following technique: at each node, we only have our local gradient computed(partial derivatives of that node), then during backpropagation, as we are receiving numerical values of gradients from upstream, we take these and multiply with local gradients to pass them on to their respective connected nodes.**\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/15.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is a generalization of the chain rule from calculus.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since ŷ(predicted label) dictates our Loss and y(actual label) is constant, for a single example, we will take the partial derivative of Loss with respect to ŷ\n",

    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/16.png/\">\n",

    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/17.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we require the derivative of sigmoid function, which can be derived as below:\n",

    "    <img src = \"assets/18.png/\">\n",

    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/20.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",

    "Let’s use this in the next backward calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/21.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The backward computations should not propagate all the way to inputs as we don’t want to change our input data(i.e. red arrows should not go to green nodes). We only want to change the weights associated with inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/22.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**The derivatives to the Loss with respect to the weights,w₁ & w₂, are ZERO! We can’t increase or decrease the weights if their derivatives are zero. So then, how do we get our desired output in this instance if we can’t figure out how to adjust the weights? The key thing to note here is that the local gradients (∂z/∂w₁ and ∂z/∂w₂) are x₁ and x₂, both of which, in this example, happens to be zero (i.e. provide no information)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us to the concept of bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bias:\n",

    "Recall the equation of a line from your high school days.\n",

    "    <img src = \"assets/23.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here b is the bias term. Intuitively, the bias tells us that all outputs computed with x(independent variable) should have an additive bias of b. So, when x=0(no information coming from the independent variable) the output should be biased to just b.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that without the bias term a line can only pass through the origin(0, 0) and the only differentiating factor between lines would then be the gradient m.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/24.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "So, using this new information let’s add another node to a neural network; the bias node. (In neural network literature, every layer, except the input layer, is assumed to have a bias node, just like the linear node, so this node is also often omitted in figures.)\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/25.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s do a forward propagation with the same example, x₁=0, x₂=0, y=0 and let’s set bias, b=0 (initial bias is always set to zero, rather than a random number), and let the backpropagation of Loss figure out the bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/26.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the forward propagation with a bias of “b=0” didn’t change our output at all, but let’s do the backward propagation before we make our final judgment.\n",
    "\n",
    "As before let’s go through backpropagation in a step by step manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/27.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/29.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hurrah! we just figured out how much to adjust the bias. Since the derivative of bias(∂L/∂b) is positive 0.125, we will need to adjust the bias by moving in the negative direction of the gradient(recall the curve of the Loss function from before).** This is technically called **gradient descent,** as we are “descending” away from the sloping region to a flat region using the direction of the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/30.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, that we’ve slightly adjusted the bias to b=-0.125, let’s test if we’ve done the right thing by doing a forward propagation and checking the new Loss.\n",

    "<p>\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Now our predicted output is ŷ≈0.469(rounded to 3 decimal places), that’s a slight improvement from the previous 0.5 and Loss is down from 0.125 to around 0.109. This slight correction is something that the neural network has ‘learned’ just by comparing its predicted output with the desired output, y, and then moving in the direction opposite of the gradient. Pretty cool, right?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you may be wondering, this is only a small improvement from the previous result and how do we get to the minimum Loss. Two things come into play: \n",
    "a) how many iterations of ‘training’ we perform (each training cycle is forward propagation followed by backward propagation and updating the weights through gradient descent). \n",
    "b) the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see **learning rate**:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning Rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall, how we calculated the new bias, above, by moving in the direction opposite of the gradient(i.e. gradient descent).\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/33.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that when we updated the bias we moved 1 step in the opposite direction of the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/34.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**We could have moved 0.5, 0.9, 2, 3 or whatever fraction of steps we desired in the opposite direction of the gradient. This ‘number of steps’ is what we define as the learning rate, often denoted with α(alpha).**\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/35.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning rate defines how quickly we reach the minimum loss. Let’s visualize below what the learning rate is doing:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/36.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see with a lower learning rate(α=0.5) our descent along the curve is slower and we take many steps to reach the minimum point. On the other hand, with a higher learning rate(α=5) we take much bigger steps and reach the minimum point much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The keen-eyed may have noticed that gradient descent steps(green arrows) keep getting smaller as we get closer and closer to the minimum, why is that? Recall, that the learning rate is being multiplied by the gradient at that point along the curve; as we descend away from sloping regions to flatter regions of the u-shaped curve, near the minimum point, the gradient keeps getting smaller and smaller, thus the steps also get smaller. Therefore, changing the learning rate during training is not necessary(some variations of gradient descent start with a high learning rate to descend quickly down the slope and then reduce it gradually, this is called **“annealing the learning rate” or “learning rate decay”)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So what’s the takeaway? Just set the learning rate as high possible and reach the optimum loss quickly. NO. Learning rate can be a double-edged sword. Too high a learning rate and the parameters(weights/biases) don’t reach the optimum instead start to diverge away from the optimum. To small a learning rate and the parameters take too long to converge to the optimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <img src = \"assets/37.png/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Small learning rate(α=5*10⁻¹⁰) resulting is numerous steps to reach the minimum point is self-explanatory; multiply gradient with a small number(α) results in a proportionally small step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large learning rate(α=50) causing gradient descent to diverge may be confounding, but the answer is quite simple; note that at each step gradient descent approximates its path downward by moving in straight lines(green arrows in the figures), in short, it estimates its path downwards. When the learning rate is too high we force gradient descent to take larger steps. Larger steps tend to overestimate the path downwards and shoot past the minimum point, then to correct the bad estimate gradient descent tries to move towards the minimum point but again overshoots past the minimum due to the large learning rate. This cycle of continuous overestimates eventually cause the results to diverge(Loss after each training cycle increase, instead of decrease).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning rate is what’s called a hyper-parameter.** Hyper-parameters are parameters that the neural network can’t essentially learn through backpropagation of gradients, they have to be hand-tuned according to the problem and its dataset, by the creator of the neural network model. (The choice of the Loss function, above, is also hyper-parameter)\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the goal is not the find the “perfect learning rate ” but instead a learning rate large enough so that the neural network trains successfully and efficiently without diverging."
