    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is most commonly used as dimensionality reduction technique in the pre-processing step for pattern-classification and machine learning applications. The goal is to project a dataset onto a lower-dimensional space with good class-separability in order avoid overfitting (“curse of dimensionality”) and also reduce computational costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The general LDA approach is very similar to a Principal Component Analysis, but in addition to finding the component axes that maximize the variance of our data (PCA), we are additionally interested in the axes that maximize the separation between multiple classes (LDA).**\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in a nutshell, often the goal of an LDA is to project a feature space (a dataset n-dimensional samples) onto a smaller subspace k (where k≤ n−1) while maintaining the class-discriminatory information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, dimensionality reduction does not only help reducing computational costs for a given classification task, but it can also be helpful to avoid overfitting by minimizing the error in parameter estimation (“curse of dimensionality”).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principal Component Analysis vs. Linear Discriminant Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are linear transformation techniques that are commonly used for dimensionality reduction. PCA can be described as an “unsupervised” algorithm, since it “ignores” class labels and its goal is to find the directions (the so-called principal components) that maximize the variance in a dataset. In contrast to PCA, LDA is “supervised” and computes the directions (“linear discriminants”) that will represent the axes that that maximize the separation between multiple classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it might sound intuitive that LDA is superior to PCA for a multi-class classification task where the class labels are known, this might not always the case.\n",
    "For example, comparisons between classification accuracies for image recognition after using PCA or LDA show that PCA tends to outperform LDA if the number of samples per class is relatively small (PCA vs. LDA, A.M. Martinez et al., 2001). In practice, it is also not uncommon to use both LDA and PCA in combination: E.g., PCA for dimensionality reduction followed by an LDA.\n",

    "### What is a “good” feature subspace?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s assume that our goal is to reduce the dimensions of a d-dimensional dataset by projecting it onto a (k)-dimensional subspace (where k<d). So, how do we know what size we should choose for k (k = the number of dimensions of the new feature subspace), and how do we know if we have a feature space that represents our data “well”?\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, we will compute eigenvectors (the components) from our data set and collect them in a so-called scatter-matrices (i.e., the in-between-class scatter matrix and within-class scatter matrix).\n",
    "Each of these eigenvectors is associated with an eigenvalue, which tells us about the “length” or “magnitude” of the eigenvectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we would observe that all eigenvalues have a similar magnitude, then this may be a good indicator that our data is already projected on a “good” feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "And in the other scenario, if some of the eigenvalues are much much larger than others, we might be interested in keeping only those eigenvectors with the highest eigenvalues, since they contain more information about our data distribution. Vice versa, eigenvalues that are close to 0 are less informative and we might consider dropping those for constructing the new feature subspace.\n",
