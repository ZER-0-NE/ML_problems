    "- 1943: If you connect very simple binary neurons, you can do logical operations or reasoning. They had an hypothesis that brain has a very large network (actually a fact) of binary neurons which can turn on/off.\n",
    "- 1947: Donald Hebb, a psychologist came up with the proposal that neurons in the brain can change their function by sort of changing the strength of the connection between the neurons. He proposed that if two neurons are active at the same time then the synapse that connects them strengthens and if they're not active then it gets depressed. This is called **Hebbian Learning**.\n",
    "- 1948: Founded a discipline called cybernetics, now called as system theory or stuff like that; out of that came the idea of self-organization - that if you connect lots of very simple elements with a very simple rule to make them compute, then they might be able to self-organize themselves into having an emergent property.\n",
    "- 1957: **Frank Rosenblatt** introduced the idea of Perceptron, which has now become the basis of Supervised Learning. This idea introduced the concept of weights and how they are updated with the corresponding loss. \n",
    "- 1961, 62: Adaline was introduced, much similar to a basic linear classifier. Around that time, neuroscientists discovered some basic properties about the visual cortex i.e., the neurons in the visual cortex basically look at kind of a small area of the visual field and many neurons at different places of individual cortex basically perform similar operation."
